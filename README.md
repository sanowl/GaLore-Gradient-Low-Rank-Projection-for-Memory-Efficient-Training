# GaLore: Gradient Low-Rank Projection for Memory-Efficient Training

GaLore is an advanced training strategy for memory-efficient training of large language models (LLMs). It leverages the low-rank structure of gradients to reduce memory usage while maintaining performance comparable to full-rank training.

## Features

- Utilizes low-rank projection of gradients to reduce memory footprint
- Supports various optimizers such as AdamW, AdaFactor, and 8-bit Adam
- Achieves performance similar to full-rank training with significantly lower memory usage
- Easy to integrate with existing PyTorch models and training pipelines

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
  ['https://github.com/sanowl/GaLore-Gradient-Low-Rank-Projection-for-Memory-Efficient-Training.git' ](https://github.com/sanowl/GaLore-Gradient-Low-Rank-Projection-for-Memory-Efficient-Training.git)
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Import the `GaLore` class and initialize it with your model, rank, alpha, optimizer, and subspace frequency:
   ```python
   from galore import GaLore
   
   model = ...  # Your PyTorch model
   rank = 256
   alpha = 0.01
   optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=1e-4)
   subspace_freq = 100
   
   galore = GaLore(model, rank, alpha, optimizer, subspace_freq)
   ```

2. Integrate GaLore into your training loop:
   ```python
   for epoch in range(epochs):
       for batch in dataloader:
           ...
           loss.backward()
           galore.step()
   ```

3. Run your training script and enjoy memory-efficient training with GaLore!
